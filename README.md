Hybrid-Data-Store-Data-Model-
=============================

Database Research Project which involved development of Hybrid Data store Database Model which combines the pros of existing Row Store model and C - store .
Worked in a team of three people and developed an algorithm that shall determine the columns of all relations which has to be stored in column based approach and those which needs to be stored in a row based approach . 
By doing so we are able to optimise the running time of queries and improves efficieny in case of huge database stystems .
Really good and satisafctory results were obtained by testing our model with the present models in terms of Query execution time .
